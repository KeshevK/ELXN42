This was a little case study educational example I did for a Big Data University course + seminar I presented. Code includes full ipython notebook on with all the lesson information on Natural Language Processing and the application of Sentiment analysis of Tweets for predictive analytics. Example supplied was for case study of Canada's 42'nd election. Right now it is easy enough to adapt to your own subject list but I will make the code work with any generalized input when I have a little more time. 

I think the really useful part for some though may be the Live Tweet Scrapper I've included as part of the code to get new testdata for the Sentiment Analysis Classifier. 

Just run tweetscraper.py and follow the prompts (I haven't added any input validation checks so please be nice to the stdin) 

Ipython notebook can run as is so take a look

Special thanks thanks to BDU, and the curators of the Sentiment140 Dataset
